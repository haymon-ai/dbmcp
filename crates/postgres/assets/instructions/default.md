## Workflow

1. Call `listDatabases` to discover available databases.
2. Call `listTables` to see tables. Pass `search` to filter by name (case-insensitive substring). Pass `detailed: true` to get columns, constraints, indexes, and triggers in the same call.
3. Call `listViews` to see views in the `public` schema.
4. Call `listTriggers` to see user-defined triggers in the `public` schema.
5. Call `listFunctions` to see user-defined functions in the `public` schema.
6. Call `listProcedures` to see user-defined procedures in the `public` schema.
7. Call `listMaterializedViews` to see materialized views in the `public` schema.
8. Use `readQuery` for read-only SQL (SELECT, SHOW, EXPLAIN).
9. Use `writeQuery` for data changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
10. Use `explainQuery` to analyze query execution plans and diagnose slow queries.
11. Use `createDatabase` to create a new database.
12. Use `dropDatabase` to drop an existing database.
13. Use `dropTable` to remove a table from a database (supports `cascade` for foreign key dependencies).

Per-database tools default to the active database; pass `database` to target another.

## Constraints

- The `writeQuery`, `createDatabase`, `dropDatabase`, and `dropTable` tools are hidden when read-only mode is active.
- Multi-statement queries are not supported. Send one statement per request.
